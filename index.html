        <h3>Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool</h3>
        <p>In this project, which can be viewed <a href="https://willk0814.github.io/arraySortingVisualizer">here</a> I built a webapp using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that allows the user to run any of 4 sorting algorithms on a randomly generated array of numbers.  In order to cresate a visual I used Chart.js.  You can view the github repo <a href="https://github.com/willk0814/arraySortingVisualizer">here</a></p>

        <h3>Business Basics for Engineers</h3>
        <p>This isn't a coding project but I wanted to showcase it here as it took a lot of work.  In my junior year I formed a RSO on campus and recruited more than 100 students before I left campus.  The club was designed to teach Engineering students some of the business skills that they would need to become effective members of the industry.  You can view the club's website <a href="https://willk0814.github.io/BBE_Website/">here</a></p>

        <h3>To-Do List Google Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>A simple google chrome extension that allows users to create new ToDo List items and delete them upon completion.  The ToDo List items are stored in local storage to preserve them between browsing sessions.  Here is a link to the project repo</p>
